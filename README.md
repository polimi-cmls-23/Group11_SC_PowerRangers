# Group11_SC_PowerRangers

The aim of this project is to implement a granular synthesizer and a user interface in SuperCollider. Through the graphical interface, it is possible to activate the different sounds and modify all the synthesis parameters. In this project, the granular synthesis is used to create a modular ambient sound, in which each buffer is independently defined through the parameters and the real-time modulation of them allowed us to create a complex ambient sound.
